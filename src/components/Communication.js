                Always verbally introduce yourself and speak directly to the
                person.
              </li>
              <li>
                When speaking to someone always use their name (if known).
              </li>
              <li>
                If you don’t know their name it can be helpful to say, "Hello I
                am …. Can I help you with anything"?
              </li>
              <li>
                Speak and avoid relying on non-verbal gestures such as pointing
                or nodding/shaking your head.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t be scared to offer help if you think the person might want
                assistance if you are unsure just ask them.
              </li>
              <li>Give the person a little extra time to respond.</li>
              <li>
                Always tell the person if you are going to leave them alone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Always tell the person if you are going to hand them over to
                someone else.

                Ask the person if they would like to be guided and follow their

              </li>
              <li>
                Provide the person with clear verbal instruction, describing the
                route you are taking, and avoiding all obstacles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Go at the person's pace and give enough time to warn of changes

              </li>
              <li>
                Tell the person what you are doing and explain each step
